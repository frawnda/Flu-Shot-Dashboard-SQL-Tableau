# Overview of Project Details
This project showcases the data visualization of a sample patient dataset from hospitals in several counties located in Massachusetts. The primary objective is to stratify any possible determinants of flu shot percentages within a given population.

While this was primarily a learning project, many of these methods are reminiscent of an upcoming project I am working on that will focus on NYC data!

Notes:
- Thank you @DataWizardry for his amazing guidance for this project! Everything from the code to the dashboard wouldn't have been possible without his course.
- All patient data was generated from Synthea, a patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients.
- PostgreSQL was used for all queries. Tableau was used for data aggregation and visualization.
- Small usage of Canva for additional icons.
- There's an additional dataset, "Encounters", that aggregates all patient hospital visits, but the file was WAY too big.

Here's the interactive Tableau dashboard: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/SampleMassachusettsHealthcareSystemFluShots2022/FinalDashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">Sample Massachusetts Healthcare System Flu Shots 2022</a>
