# Flu-Shot-Dashboard-SQL-Tableau
This project showcases the data visualization of a sample patient dataset from hospitals in several counties located in Massachusetts. The primary objective is to stratify any possible determinants of flu shot percentages within a given population.

While this was primarily a learning project, many of these methods are reminiscent of an upcoming project I am working on that will focus on NYC data! 

Notes:
- Thank you for @DataWizardry for his amazing guidance for this project! Everything from the code to the dashboard wouldn't have been possible without his course.
- All patient data was generated from Synthea, a patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients.
- PostgreSQL was used for all queries. Tableau was used for data aggregation and visualization.
- Small usage of Canva for additional icons.
